### Phase 2 Deployment Plan
1. Deploy Cloud Functions to Firebase
2. Create EAS Build for standalone testing
3. Test AI features end-to-end
4. Internal beta testing
5. App Store submission (future)

---

## Cost Tracking

### Firebase Usage (Free Tier)
- Well within limits for MVP
- Monitor closely when AI features launch

### OpenAI Costs (To Track)
- GPT-4: $0.01/1K tokens input, $0.03/1K tokens output
- GPT-3.5-turbo: $0.0005/1K tokens input, $0.0015/1K tokens output
- Embeddings: $0.0001/1K tokens
- Target: < $10/month for beta testing

---

## What's Working Well

- **Optimistic UI**: Feels instant and responsive
- **Thread Architecture**: Clean separation, works great
- **Read Receipts**: Intuitive, especially "Read by" names in groups
- **State Management**: useReducer pattern scales well
- **Firebase Services**: Abstraction makes code clean and testable
- **Offline Persistence**: Works seamlessly, no extra code needed

## What We Learned

- Firestore composite indexes are essential for performance
- Realtime DB better than Firestore for presence/typing (lower latency)
- Thread filtering on client side works well with proper indexes
- Group read receipts need special "all read" logic
- Optimistic UI requires careful tempId ‚Üí realId management
- Firebase security rules prevent entire classes of bugs

## Next Major Milestones

1. ‚úÖ MVP Complete (Phase 1)
2. üéØ **Current**: Set up Firebase Functions + OpenAI (Phase 2.1)
3. ‚è≥ Thread Summarization Working (Phase 2.2)
4. ‚è≥ All 6 AI Features Implemented (Phase 2.3-2.6)
5. ‚è≥ Beta Testing with Real Users
6. ‚è≥ App Store Launch
