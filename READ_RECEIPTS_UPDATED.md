- **When**: 
  - **1-on-1 Chat**: Message sent but not read yet by recipient
  - **Group Chat**: Message sent but NOT read by ALL members yet
- **Icon**: ✓ Single gray checkmark
- **Meaning**: Delivered to server, waiting for everyone to read

#### ✓✓ Read (Double Gray Ticks)

## Behavior Examples

### 1-on-1 Chat

#### Example: Alice → Bob

```
Timeline:

T+0s: Alice sends "Hello!"
┌──────────────────┐
│ Hello!           │
│ 3:45 PM ⏰       │  ← Sending
└──────────────────┘

T+1s: Message sent to server
┌──────────────────┐
│ Hello!           │
│ 3:45 PM ✓        │  ← Single tick (Bob hasn't read)
└──────────────────┘

T+30s: Bob opens chat and reads
┌──────────────────┐
│ Hello!           │
│ 3:45 PM ✓✓       │  ← Double blue ticks (Bob read it)
└──────────────────┘
```

**Simple Rule**: 
- ✓ = Sent but not read
- ✓✓ = Read by recipient

---

### Group Chat (3 people)

#### Example: Alice → [Bob, Charlie]

```
Timeline:

T+0s: Alice sends "Team meeting at 5pm"
┌───────────────────────┐
│ Team meeting at 5pm   │
│ 3:45 PM ⏰            │  ← Sending
└───────────────────────┘

T+1s: Message sent to server
┌───────────────────────┐
│ Team meeting at 5pm   │
│ 3:45 PM ✓             │  ← Single tick (no one read yet)
└───────────────────────┘
Read by: (none)

T+10s: Bob opens chat and reads
┌───────────────────────┐
│ Team meeting at 5pm   │
│ 3:45 PM ✓             │  ← Still single tick (Charlie hasn't read)
└───────────────────────┘
Read by Bob

T+5m: Charlie opens chat and reads
┌───────────────────────┐
│ Team meeting at 5pm   │
│ 3:45 PM ✓✓            │  ← NOW double blue ticks (ALL read)
└───────────────────────┘
Read by Bob, Charlie
```

**Group Rule**:
- ✓ = Not everyone has read yet
- ✓✓ = ALL members have read
- "Read by" text shows who specifically has read

---

### Group Chat (5 people)

#### Example: Alice → [Bob, Charlie, David, Eve]

```
State 1: Just sent
✓ Single tick
Read by: (none)

State 2: Some people read (Bob, Charlie)
✓ Still single tick
Read by Bob, Charlie

State 3: More people read (Bob, Charlie, David)
✓ Still single tick
Read by Bob, Charlie, David

State 4: Everyone reads (Bob, Charlie, David, Eve)
✓✓ Double blue ticks
Read by Bob, Charlie, David, Eve
```

**Key Insight**: The message only gets double blue ticks when the **LAST person** reads it.

## Implementation Details

### MessageBubble Component

**Logic Flow:**
```typescript
1. Check if message is from current user
   └─ NO → Don't show any ticks
   └─ YES → Continue...

2. Check delivery status
   └─ SENDING → Show clock ⏰
   └─ SENT or DELIVERED → Check if fully read
       └─ Fully read? → Show ✓✓ (blue)
       └─ Not fully read? → Show ✓ (gray)
   └─ READ → Show ✓✓ (blue)

3. How to determine "fully read":
   - If 1-on-1: Check deliveryStatus === READ
   - If group: Check if ALL other participants are in readBy array
```

**Code:**
```typescript
const isFullyRead = () => {
  if (!participants || participants.length === 0) {
    // 1-on-1 chat
    return message.deliveryStatus === DeliveryStatus.READ;
  }

  // Group chat: ALL participants (except sender) must have read
  const otherParticipants = participants.filter(
    (p) => p.id !== currentUserId
  );
  
  return otherParticipants.every((p) => message.readBy.includes(p.id));
};
```

### Firestore markMessagesAsRead Function

**Logic Flow:**
```typescript
1. User opens chat
2. Get all unread messages
3. For each message:
   a. Add current user to readBy array
   b. Count how many participants have now read
   c. If ALL participants (except sender) have read:
      └─ Set deliveryStatus = READ
   d. Otherwise:
      └─ Keep deliveryStatus = SENT
4. Commit batch update
```

**Code:**
```typescript
const newReadBy = [...message.readBy, userId];

// Check if ALL participants (except sender) have now read
const otherParticipants = participants.filter(
  (p: string) => p !== message.senderId
);
const allRead = otherParticipants.every((p: string) => 
  newReadBy.includes(p)
);

// Only set to READ if all participants have read
const newStatus = allRead ? DeliveryStatus.READ : DeliveryStatus.SENT;

batch.update(doc.ref, {
  readBy: arrayUnion(userId),
  deliveryStatus: newStatus,
});
```

## Why This Is Better

### 1. Clear Engagement Tracking
**Problem**: Before, you couldn't tell if EVERYONE in the group saw your message.

**Solution**: Now you know immediately:
- ✓ = Still waiting for some people
- ✓✓ = Everyone has seen it

### 2. Reduces Confusion
**Problem**: Different apps have different tick meanings.

**Solution**: Simple, universal logic:
- 1 tick = Not fully read
- 2 ticks = Fully read by everyone

### 3. Better for Team Communication
**Problem**: Important messages might be missed by some team members.

**Solution**: 
- You see ✓ until everyone reads
- Plus "Read by" text shows exactly who has read
- Know who to follow up with

## Use Case Examples

### Use Case 1: Work Team
```
Manager: "Please review the proposal by EOD"
✓ Single tick + "Read by Alice, Bob"
→ Know that Charlie hasn't seen it yet
→ Send direct reminder to Charlie
```

### Use Case 2: Family Group
```
Mom: "Dinner at 6pm tonight"
✓✓ Double ticks + "Read by Dad, Sister, Brother"
→ Everyone acknowledged
→ Proceed with confidence
```

### Use Case 3: Event Planning
```
You: "Party moved to Saturday instead of Friday!"
✓ Single tick + "Read by Amy, Ben"
→ Carlos and Diana haven't read
→ Important change, call them directly
```

### Use Case 4: Project Deadline
```
You: "Deadline extended to next Monday"
✓✓ Double ticks + "Read by Emma, Frank, George"
→ Everyone knows about the extension
→ No need to follow up
```

## Comparison with Other Apps

### WhatsApp
- ✓ = Delivered to server
- ✓✓ (gray) = Delivered to recipient's device
- ✓✓ (blue) = Read by recipient
- **Groups**: ✓✓ blue when all read

**Aligna**: Simpler - just ✓ or ✓✓ (blue)

### Telegram
- ✓ = Delivered to server
- ✓✓ = Delivered to recipient
- Shows read count in groups
- **Groups**: Must tap to see who read

**Aligna**: Shows names immediately

### iMessage
- "Delivered" text = Sent
- "Read" text = Opened
- **Groups**: Doesn't show who specifically read

**Aligna**: Shows specific names + visual ticks

---

## Database Structure

### Message Document
```typescript
{
  id: "msg123",
  text: "Hello everyone!",
  senderId: "alice_id",
  conversationId: "conv456",
  timestamp: 1698765432000,
  deliveryStatus: "sent", // or "read"
  readBy: ["alice_id", "bob_id"], // Array grows as people read
  isSynced: true
}
```

### Status Progression

**1-on-1 Chat:**
```
1. Sent:
   deliveryStatus: "sent"
   readBy: ["sender_id"]

2. Recipient reads:
   deliveryStatus: "read"
   readBy: ["sender_id", "recipient_id"]
```

**Group Chat (3 people):**
```
1. Sent:
   deliveryStatus: "sent"
   readBy: ["sender_id"]

2. First person reads:
   deliveryStatus: "sent" ← Still "sent"
   readBy: ["sender_id", "user1_id"]

3. Second person reads:
   deliveryStatus: "read" ← NOW "read" (all read)
   readBy: ["sender_id", "user1_id", "user2_id"]
```
