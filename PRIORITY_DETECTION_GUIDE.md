# Priority Detection - Testing Guide

## Date: October 26, 2025

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Backend (Already Complete)
- ✅ `detectPriority` Cloud Function - Manual priority detection
- ✅ `autoDetectPriority` Cloud Function - Automatic background detection on new messages
- ✅ Stores results in `messagePriorities` collection
- ✅ Updates message documents with `aiPriority` and `priorityScore` fields

### Frontend (Just Completed)
- ✅ Updated `Message` type with `aiPriority?: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'` and `priorityScore?: number`
- ✅ `PriorityBadge` component displays priority with color-coded icons
- ✅ Integrated priority badges into `MessageBubble` component
- ✅ Added "Priority" test button to Test tab
- ✅ Real-time listener automatically picks up priority updates

## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Priority Detection (Background)
When you send a new message:
1. The `autoDetectPriority` Cloud Function triggers automatically
2. AI analyzes the message for urgency indicators:
   - **High Priority**: Urgent keywords (ASAP, urgent, critical, emergency), multiple mentions, question marks
   - **Medium Priority**: Important keywords, requests for action, deadlines
   - **Low Priority**: Casual conversation, acknowledgments
3. Priority is stored in Firestore
4. Message document is updated with priority fields
5. Real-time listener picks up the change
6. Priority badge appears above the message bubble

### Manual Priority Detection (Test Tab)
1. Go to Test tab
2. Find a conversation
3. Tap the red "Priority" button
4. Analyzes the last 5 messages in that conversation
5. Shows breakdown: 🔴 High, 🟠 Medium, 🟢 Low
6. Priority badges appear on analyzed messages

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test Automatic Detection

Send messages with different priority levels:

**High Priority Messages:**
```
"URGENT: Need the production deployment done ASAP!"
"@Sarah @John this is critical - server is down!"
"EMERGENCY: Client is waiting for this NOW"
"Can someone help with this immediately???"
```

**Medium Priority Messages:**
```
"Can you review the PR when you get a chance?"
"We should discuss this in the next meeting"
"Please send me the updated designs by Friday"
"@Mike, could you take a look at this?"
```

**Low Priority Messages:**
```
"Thanks!"
"Sounds good 👍"
"How was your weekend?"
"I'll be out of office tomorrow"
```

**What to Expect:**
- Wait 2-3 seconds after sending
- Priority badge should appear above high/medium priority messages
- Low priority messages may not show a badge (by design)

### Step 2: Test Manual Detection

1. Open the **Test** tab (bottom navigation)
2. Find a conversation with recent messages
3. Tap the **red "Priority" button**
4. Wait for analysis (5-10 seconds)
5. You'll see an alert: "Analyzed 5 messages: 🔴 2 🟠 2 🟢 1"
6. Go back to the chat
7. Scroll up to see priority badges on analyzed messages

### Step 3: Verify Badge Appearance

Priority badges appear **above** the message bubble:

**High Priority (Red):**
- 🔴 Red alert icon
- Light red background
- Appears on urgent messages

**Medium Priority (Orange):**
- 🟠 Orange info icon
- Light orange background  
- Appears on important messages

**Low Priority (Green):**
- 🟢 Green checkmark icon
- Light green background
- May not be shown by default

### Step 4: Test Real-Time Updates

1. Have two devices or users in the same conversation
2. User A sends a high-priority message: "URGENT: Need help!"
3. User B should see the priority badge appear automatically after 2-3 seconds
4. No manual refresh needed

## 📊 Priority Detection Logic

The AI considers:

### High Priority Indicators
- **Keywords**: URGENT, ASAP, critical, emergency, immediate, NOW, help needed
- **Mentions**: Multiple @mentions in one message
- **Punctuation**: Multiple question marks or exclamation marks
- **Tone**: Commands, demands, urgent requests
- **Context**: Time-sensitive language

### Medium Priority Indicators  
- **Keywords**: important, please, should, need to, deadline, review, discuss
- **Mentions**: Single @mention
- **Questions**: Direct questions requiring response
- **Requests**: Action items or follow-ups

### Low Priority Indicators
- **Keywords**: thanks, ok, sounds good, noted, acknowledged
- **Casual**: Greetings, small talk, emojis
- **FYI**: Information sharing without action needed
- **Status**: Out of office, status updates

## 🎨 UI Design

### Badge Positioning
- Priority badge appears **above** the message bubble
- Aligned with the message (left for others, right for own messages)
- Small margin (4px) between badge and bubble

### Badge Styles
```
High:    [🔴 icon] on #FFEBEE background, #FF3B30 color
Medium:  [🟠 icon] on #FFF3E0 background, #FF9500 color
Low:     [🟢 icon] on #E8F5E9 background, #34C759 color
```

### Badge Variants
- **Icon only** (default): Small circular badge with icon
- **With label**: Shows "High Priority" text (not currently used)
- **With score**: Shows confidence score (visible in code, not UI)

## 📱 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Emergency Message
```
User: "EMERGENCY: Production server is down! Need help NOW!"
Expected: 🔴 High priority badge appears automatically
```

### Scenario 2: Action Request
```
User: "@John can you review the PR by end of day?"
Expected: 🟠 Medium priority badge appears automatically  
```

### Scenario 3: Casual Chat
```
User: "Thanks! Have a great weekend 😊"
Expected: 🟢 Low priority badge (or no badge)
```

### Scenario 4: Group Discussion
```
User: "We should schedule a meeting to discuss the roadmap"
Expected: 🟠 Medium priority badge
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Priority Badges Appearing

**Check 1: Are Cloud Functions deployed?**
```bash
firebase functions:list
# Should show: autoDetectPriority, detectPriority
```

**Check 2: Is OpenAI API key configured?**
```bash
firebase functions:config:get openai
# Should show: { "key": "sk-..." }
```

**Check 3: Check function logs**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only autoDetectPriority --lines 30
```

**Check 4: Verify Firestore updates**
- Open Firebase Console → Firestore
- Navigate to a message document
- Check if `aiPriority` and `priorityScore` fields exist

### Priority Seems Wrong

**Remember:**
- AI makes educated guesses based on patterns
- Confidence scores range from 0-100
- Context matters (previous messages influence detection)
- Not all messages need priority badges

**To improve accuracy:**
- Use clear, direct language
- Include urgency keywords when appropriate
- Use @mentions for important requests

### Badge Not Updating in Real-Time

**Check:**
1. Is the chat screen active? (Listener only active when viewing chat)
2. Try closing and reopening the conversation
3. Check if background function completed (logs)
4. Firebase real-time sync may have delay (2-3 seconds normal)

## 💰 Cost Considerations

### Per Message Detection
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo (cost-effective)
- **Cost**: ~$0.0001 per message (~0.01¢)
- **Trigger**: Every new message (main conversation only, not threads)

### Estimated Monthly Costs
- **10 users, 100 messages/day each**: ~$3/month
- **50 users, 200 messages/day each**: ~$30/month

### Optimization Tips
1. **Skip Low-Value Messages**: Filter out very short messages ("ok", "thanks")
2. **Batch Processing**: Process in batches instead of real-time
3. **Cache Results**: Don't re-analyze edited messages
4. **Threshold Filtering**: Only show high/medium priority badges

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Additional Features (Optional)
1. **Priority Inbox**: Filter view showing only high-priority messages
2. **Priority Notifications**: Enhanced push notifications for high-priority
3. **Priority Search**: Search filter by priority level
4. **Priority Settings**: User preferences for sensitivity
5. **Priority Statistics**: Dashboard showing priority breakdown

### Improvements
1. **Training**: Fine-tune model based on user feedback
2. **Context Window**: Consider more messages for better accuracy
3. **User Patterns**: Learn user-specific urgency patterns
4. **Business Hours**: Adjust priority based on time of day
